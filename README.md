# Multiplayer PvP Tic-Tac-Toe Game Specification

## Overview:
This document outlines the requirements and technical specifications for a multiplayer PvP Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game will allow two players to join a session using a session code, play real-time matches, and track scores. The first version of the game will focus on simplicity and low-latency interactions, with scalability and additional features to be considered in future versions.

### Technologies:
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with React
- **Backend**: Go with Gin Gonic
- **WebSockets**: Gorilla WebSocket
- **Hosting**: VPS (Virtual Private Server)
- **WebSocket Secure Connection (in Production)**: `wss://`
- **Environment Setup**: Separate configurations for local testing # Multiplayer PvP Tic-Tac-Toe Game Checklist

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Environment Configuration

### Project Initialization

- [ ] Write functions to handle incoming messages and update the UI accordingly.

### Reconnection and Disconnect Handling
- [ ] Implement a retry mechanism on the client (up to 5 retries with 5-second intervals).
- [ ] On the backend, implement a 60-second timeout for disconnected players, declaring the opponent the winner if not reconnected.

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Write integration tests simulating real-time communication and reconnection scenarios.

---

## Phase 5: Rematch Functionality and Score Tracking

### Rematch Implementation
- [ ] Create a backend endpoint (or WebSocket handler) for processing rematch requests.
- [ ] Update session data to reset the game board while retaining match history.

### Frontend Rematch Flow
- [ ] Add a “Rematch” button in the UI.
- [ ] Ensure the rematch request is sent only when both players agree.

### Score Tracking
- [ ] Store match scores (wins, losses, ties) in session memory.
- [ ] Update the UI to display ongoing match history.

### Testing
- [ ] Write tests for rematch logic and score updating.
- [ ] Verify through manual testing that rematches only trigger when both players consent.

## Phase 7: Deployment and Documentation

### Deployment Setup
- [ ] Prepare production configuration for secure connections (HTTPS, wss://).
- [ ] Test deployment on a VPS in a staging environment.

### Documentation
- [ ] Write developer documentation covering setup, environment variables, and code structure.
- [ ] Create user guides for joining sessions and playing the game.

### Final Quality Assurance
- [ ] Review the entire checklist and confirm that every step has been implemented and tested.
- [ ] Plan for future enhancements (animations, score persistence with a database, user authentication).
and production
- **No Database**: No database integration in this version

## 1. Game Session Management

- **Session Lifetime**: 
  - Sessions are temporary and stored only in memory.
  - A session expires when no active players are present or when a player disconnects and fails to reconnect within the timeout period.
  
- **Session Code**:
  - A unique 6-digit alphanumeric, case-sensitive code is generated when a session is created.
  - Players can join a session by entering this code on the homepage.

---

## 2. User Identification

- **Player Nicknames**: 
  - Players are identified by their nickname.
  - A player must enter their nickname and the session code when joining a game.
  
- **Authentication**: 
  - No authentication is required in this version. It’s a purely ad-hoc system.

---

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

- **Game Board**:
  - A simple 3x3 grid represents the game board.
  - Players take turns to place either "X" or "O" on the grid.

- **Turn Order**:
  - The first player is randomly chosen in the first round.
  - Starting player alternates between rounds (for rematches).

- **Winning Conditions**:
  - A player wins if they place 3 of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
  - A visual cue (e.g., highlighting the winning line) is displayed when a player wins.

- **Tie**:
  - A tie occurs when the grid is full, and neither player has won.
  - A specific message should be displayed for a tie, and the tie will be tracked in the match history.

---

## 4. Real-Time Communication

- **WebSockets**:
  - WebSockets (via **Gorilla WebSocket**) will be used for real-time communication between the client and server.
  - The server will handle real-time updates, including player moves and game state changes.

- **Automatic Reconnection**:
  - The game should attempt to reconnect automatically up to 5 times with a 5-second interval before giving up.
  
---

## 5. Disconnect Handling

- **Reconnect Timeout**:
  - Players have 60 seconds to reconnect if they disconnect.
  - If the player does not reconnect within this period, the opponent is declared the winner.
  
- **Session Expiration**:
  - The game session expires if the player does not reconnect in time, or if an invalid session code is entered.
  - In case of an expired or invalid session, an error message will be displayed, and the player will have the option to return to the home page.

---

## 6. Rematch Functionality

- **Rematch**:
  - Players can agree to a rematch after a game ends.
  - A rematch button will be presented to both players, and both players must agree to start a new round.
  
- **Match History**:
  - The score should be displayed after each game and will include the number of wins, losses, and ties.
  - The score is updated each time a new round begins.

- **Session Persistence**:
  - The session persists across rematches, so the match history continues to be tracked within the same session.

- **Player Leaving**:
  - If a player leaves during the rematch request, the session is immediately ended, and the remaining player will be notified.

---

## 7. User Interface (UI) and Experience

- **Layout**:
  - The game will feature a simple, clean layout with a basic 3x3 grid for the game board.
  - Basic buttons will be used for player actions (e.g., "Start New Game", "Join Session", "Rematch").
  - A visual indicator will show whose turn it is.
  - The game will display a result screen after the game ends with an option to return to the home page.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**:
  - The game will be fully responsive, adjusting automatically to different screen sizes (e.g., phone, tablet, desktop).
  - Layout and elements (like buttons) will adapt to smaller screens.

- **No Sound/Animations**:
  - Initially, there will be no sound effects or move animations.
  - Visual cues will be used for winning lines or ties.

---

## 8. Error Handling

- **Session Expired or Invalid Code**:
  - If a player enters an invalid or expired session code, an error message will be displayed, and they will be given an option to return to the home page.

- **Game Disconnections**:
  - If a disconnection occurs and the player fails to reconnect within 60 seconds, the opponent wins, and the game session is marked as complete.

---

## 9. Deployment and Environment

- **Hosting**:
  - The game will be hosted on a VPS.
  
- **Environment Setup**:
  - The frontend will not hardcode API URLs. It will be configured to handle local testing and production environments separately.
  - In the production environment, HTTPS and WebSocket (wss://) will be used for secure connections.
